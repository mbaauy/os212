# WEEK 06
1. Process in Operating Systems: [What is a Process in Operating Systems](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-a-process-in-operating-system-and-what-are-the-different-states-of-a-process) & [Process in Operating Systems](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes) & [Process Management](https://www.guru99.com/process-management-pcb.html)<br>
In the Operating System, a process is something that is currently under execution. The articles above provide a fairly complete explanation of what a process is.


2. Thread in Opearting Systems: [What is a Thread in Opearting Systems](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-a-thread-in-os-and-what-are-the-differences-between-a-process-and-a-thread) & [Multithreading](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/multithreading) <br>
A thread is an execution unit that has its own program counter, a stack and a set of registers that reside in a process. The articles above provide a fairly complete explanation of what a thread is.

3. Process vs Thread: [Process vs Thread](https://www.javatpoint.com/process-vs-thread) & [Difference between Process and Thread](https://www.guru99.com/difference-between-process-and-thread) <br>
Tread and process are two related things. Threads can't exist outside any process. Also, each thread belongs to exactly one process. Distinguishing the two is sometimes quite tricky. But the articles above can help us to understand the difference between the two.

4. Sleep vs Wait: [Sleep vs Wait in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wd-_TT0a5d4&ab_channel=CppNuts) & [Sleep vs Wait in Java](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/multi-threading/sleep-vs-wait/)<br>

5. Fork and Exec in C: [Fork and Exec Example](https://linuxhint.com/fork-exec-coding-c/) & [Fork and Exec](https://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~dwharder/icsrts/Tutorials/fork_exec/) & [Using Fork and Exec in C](http://boron.physics.metu.edu.tr/ozdogan/SystemsProgramming/week4/node10.html)<br>
There is zero possibility of occurring more than one program at a time in C. Only a single task can happen at a particular time, which means it doesnâ€™t allow concurrent programs to run. It causes you to wait for the completion of one process to execute the other one. To avoid this troubleshooting problem, we may need to learn fork() and exec() that is used to overcome the waiting and to allow concurrency in our system.

# WEEK 07
1. [Process Synchronization](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/5_Synchronization.html)<br>

2. [Mutex Lock for Linux Thread Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-lock-for-linux-thread-synchronization/)<br>
After learning about process synchronization, we may have realized that it can cause problems. The most popular way of achieving thread synchronization is by using mutexes.

3. Semaphores: [Semaphores](https://riptutorial.com/c/example/31715/semaphores) & [Use Semaphores in C](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/use-posix-semaphores-c/)<br>
Like mutex lock, semaphores are also very useful in process synchronization and multithreading. Semaphores are used to synchronize operations between two or more processes.

4. Mutex vs Semaphore: [Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://www.guru99.com/mutex-vs-semaphore.html) & [Difference between Mutex and Semaphore in Operating System](https://afteracademy.com/blog/difference-between-mutex-and-semaphore-in-operating-system) & [Mutex vs Semaphore (1)](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/semaphore-vs-mutex) & [Mutex vs Semaphore (2)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mutex-vs-semaphore/)<br>
Semaphore and mutex are two mechanisms through which we can implement synchronization and manage process coordination. In those articles, weâ€™ll look into these two synchronization utilities and compare various characteristics.

# WEEK 08
1. [CPU Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html#2)<br>

Scheduling Algorithm: [Part 1](https://medium.com/geekculture/scheduling-algorithms-in-operating-systems-d7d8b0d504aa) & [Part 2](https://afteracademy.com/blog/process-scheduling-algorithms-in-the-operating-system) & [Part 3](https://vsonwalkar3.medium.com/scheduling-algorithms-in-operating-system-bade5f192ca4)<br>
In a system, there are a number of processes that are present in different states at a particular time. Some processes may be in the waiting state, others may be in the running state and so on. Like humans, the operating system needs to plan its activities. Therefore, it's important to learn process scheduling.

# WEEK 09
